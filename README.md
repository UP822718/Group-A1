Todo list

1/04/2019 TO DO:

SERVER SIDE:

1. [ ] Consolidate SQL statements for retrieving hydration, weight, calories, and steps into 1 call
2. [ ] use document.GetElementByID to parse the data called from the database from html to javascript, so that it can be used in the graphs 
3. [ ] Add fuctions for inserting new hydration, weight, calories, or steps
4. [ ] Add DateTime field for all stats stored in DB

CLIENT SIDE:

1. [ ] Add area for displaying current stats, with relevent ID's so that they can be selected via JS and used in the graphs
2. [ ] Re-Work statistics_page.html so that the forms are only used for inputting new stats

GOAL: FINISH BY 6pm 2/04/2019. If we achieve this we have time to get feedback from the mentor meeting on wednesday (3/04/2019)
